# Module in Node JS

In Node.js, a module is simply a piece of reusable code that can be imported into other parts of your application. It allows you to break your code into smaller, more manageable pieces. Node.js provides both built-in modules (like http, fs, etc.) and custom modules that you can create yourself.

## Types of Modules in Node.js

- Core Modules: These come with Node.js and are available by default.
- Local Modules: These are custom modules that you create to organize your own code.
- Third-party Modules: These are modules that you install using npm (Node Package Manager), like express, lodash, etc.

By understanding modules, you can better organize your Node.js applications and reuse code. This helps keep your application maintainable and scalable as it grows. Keep experimenting with core and custom modules as you continue learning!
